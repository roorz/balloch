Create an elegant, delightful React date range selection component with the following features:

1. The current month can be programatically set: for example January 2025.
2. Two month view calendars are displayed side by side; the left is for the current month, the right is the next month. 
3. Unavailable dates can be programatically set so that they can't be selected by the user. Each unavailable day should appear in grey text and striked out.
4. The user can select any available start date and end date from either calendar. A valid date range can only include consecutive available days; the date range cannot include any unavailable dates.
5. The user can use back "<" and forward ">" controls at the top of the calendars to select the previous/next month.
6. When a valid date range is selected, each day within the date range should be clearly highlighted as within the range.

The goal is to enable the user to very quickly select a date range from the available dates:
- Create a thoughtful rubric structure
- Add helpful prompts/placeholders
- Build in intelligent validation

Make sure to
 - Call the element DateRangeComponent
 - Start the code with "use client"
 - Generate React Class Components; don't use useState, useEffect.
 
Respond with the code only! Nothing else!
